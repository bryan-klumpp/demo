<html><head><title>Server Configuration for JDemoWeb and JDemoWebLegacy</title></head><body>
<p>
The projects JDemoWeb and JDemoWebLegacy have been tested with Tomcat 9.0.43 in the following context:
<br/>Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers (includes Incubating components)
<br/>Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0)
<br/>Build id: 20210312-0638
<br/>OS: Windows 10, v.10.0, x86_64 / win32
<br/>Java version: 15.0.2
</p><p>
There is a bug in Spring 2.5.0 that causes an error on server starting asking for a missing config directory.  The workaround that I used was detailed <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/26627">here</a> and involves editing the Tomcat server launch configuration to add the environment variable <code>SPRING_CONFIG_LOCATION</code> with value <code>optional:classpath:/,optional:classpath:/config/,optional:file:./,optional:file:./config/</code>. 
</p><p>
The JDemoWeb project includes an example of including another Eclipse project as a referenced library.  In Rational Application Developer this is more automated (called a "Web Library Project"), but for the base Eclipse configuration you'll need to add the project JDemoWebLib in the "User Entries" classpath in the server launch configuration.

To verify configuration for JDemoWeb, hit the URL <a href="http://localhost:8080/sbw/junit">http://localhost:8080/sbw/junit</a> which uses the JUnit text running to run some JUnit tests (a bit unorthodox, but this is just a demo).  To verify configuration for JDemoWebLegacy, use <a href="http://localhost:8080/springweb/cust">http://localhost:8080/springweb/cust</a>.   Note that some of these tests are expecting test data in a MySQL database which you'll need to create and populate with a bit of test data (TODO: insert data in test setup, better documentation on database creation).
