/**
 * The .custom. and sub-packages can hold code extensions that individual users
 * create for their own consumption that are either unlikely to be useful to
 * others, too dependent on personal knowledge, undocumented, or too buggy to be
 * shared yet without a healthy "use your own risk" warning or a .gitignore
 * One way to launch SwingShell with your own additional
 * customizations, without modifying core code, is to put your launcher class in
 * this package and pass a BJShellCustomizer to the SwingShell constructor.
