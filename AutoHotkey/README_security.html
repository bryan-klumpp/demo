<p>AutoHotkey can be downloaded at https://www.autohotkey.com/  While the language is not type-safe and not easily scalable (therefore more suited to smaller programs), its tight integration with Windows makes it ideal for automating a lot of routine tasks.  It's fully open source.
</p><p>I am not a security expert, but I do want to address security a bit as AutoHotkey, while not unknown, is not ubiquitous in software development.  I (Bryan Klumpp) expressly disclaim any liability for suggesting the use of this program.  While I can't make any guarantees for any program as to security, I do want to note that at least some flagging by malware scanners may have been due to the nature of scripting and how AutoHotkey makes an executable script: a black hat writes a malicious script, it gets bundled with the executable (AutoHotkey allows "compiling" scripts to .exe), malware scanners flag and remember it, and thus the AutoHotkey core code can mistakenly be conflated with malware.  See https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=21201  Please keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to compile scripts to .exe and deciding how to restrict editing access, and use a multi-scanner like virustotal.com on downloads.  Notably, AutoHotkey can be run without installation or administrative privileges.  While I'm not a security expert, that would still leave open the potential for a keylogger in a malicious script/executable, because access to keyboard/mouse input is a core feature of AutoHotkey.
