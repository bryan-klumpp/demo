Windows now comes with Hibernate disabled by default, but it can be enabled with the following steps:
1. Try to open PowerShell using "Run as administrator"
2. If you are simply prompted to click "Ok" or "Yes", then you have the privileges needed to complete this on your own; otherwise, if prompted to enter a username, you will need the assistance of someone with administrative privileges.
3. In PowerShell, run the following command:   powercfg  /h  on   (no errors after pressing Enter means it worked; afterward, leave the Powershell window open)
4. Open the classic Power Control Panel (there are various ways to get to this, but with the Start menu visible you can type powercfg.cpl )
5. Click "Choose what the power buttons do"
6. Click "Change settings that are currently unavailable"
7. Check the box to enable Hibernate
8. Back in the PowerShell window, run the following command: gpupdate  /force  (this will take several minutes to complete)
9. Verify that Hibernate is now an option from the Start Menu's Power section
